<h2>Intern</h2>

<h5>By Doctor X</h5>

<br>
<em><h3>The Man on the Spot</h3></em>
<p>This book is a journal of the most critical year in<br>
    the training of a present-day
<a href="https://archive.org/stream/intern00doct#page/n13/mode/2up">doctor</a>

    of medicine: the year that he<br>
    spends as a hospital intern.<br>
    At the very start, I should make clear what I mean by "journal."<br>
    This is not a memoir or a recollection, But an actual diary, recorded<br>
    on tape a bit at a time, day by day and week by week, throughout<br>
    the year of my internship. Parts of it were recorded from the point<br>
    of exhaustion; other parts reflect the discouragement, the frustra-<br>
    tion, the depression or the insecurity of the moment. At times I<br>
    dictated in protest of high indignation; at other times in exultation<br>
    or excitement. The result is a true and valid document of my in-<br>
    ternship as I experienced it-a reading of the cards as they fell, for<br>
    better or worse. There is nothing here which did not indeed hap-<br>
    pen; inevitably much that did happen was never recorded. The<br>
    transcript has been edited for coherence and grammar, But every<br>
    effort has been made to leave the diary unaltered by afterthought or<br>
    retrospection.

<p>As such, this is a highly personal document. It deals with the things that<br>
    happened to <em>me</em>, with <em>my</em> thoughts, <em>my</em> opinions, <em>my</em> reactions. In regard to<br>
    details, other interns doubtless had other experiences, thought other things<br> or reacted in
    other ways. Yet over all, I am convinced that my intern year<br>
    was representative of intern training in general, not very much better nor<br>
    very much worse than the training of thousands of fledgling doctors in<br>
    hundreds of hospitals across the country during the year of my internship...<br>
    or today. The details in this document are unique, But the message it conveys<br> is universal.<br>

    At the time of the recording I had no clear idea just what I was going to do<br>
    with this mass of material when I had finished it, if anything. But I felt that<br>
    here was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to document an extraordinary<br>
    experience, so fiercely crowded and so rich in its content and implications<br>
    that it should not be lost. There is not other year in a doctor's life to compare<br>
    with internship, no year so crucial to his growth as a doctor, no other single<br>
    year which so powerfully molds and influences his entire professional life.<br>
    Residency training may be similar, But never quite the same. Practice, still<br>
    later, is not even remotely the same. There is no going back, no recapturing<br>
    the world the intern lives in or the life that he lives in the world.
