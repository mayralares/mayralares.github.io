<h2>Intern</h2>
<h5>By Doctor X</h5>
<em><h3>The Man on the Spot</em></h3>

<p>This book is a journal of the most critical year in<br>
    the training of a present-day <a href="https://archive.org/stream/intern00doct#page/n13/mode/2up">doctor</a>
    of medicine: the year that he<br>
    spends as a hospital intern.<br>
    At the very start, I should make clear what I mean by "journal."<br>
    This is not a memoir or a recollection, but an actual diary, recorded<br>
    on tape a bit at a time, day by day and week by week, throughout<br>
    the year of my internship. Parts of it were recorded from the point<br>
    of exhaustion; other parts reflect the discouragement, the frustra-<br>
    tion, the depression or the insecurity of the moment. At times I<br>
    dictated in protest of high indignation; at other times in exultation<br>
    or excitement. The result is a true and valid document of my in-<br>
    ternship as I experienced it-a reading of the cards as they fell, for<br>
    better or worse. There is nothing here which did not indeed hap-<br>
    pen; inevitably much that did happen was never recorded. The<br>
    transcript has been edited for coherence and grammar, but every<br>
    effort has been made to leave the diary unaltered by afterthought or<br>
    retrospection.
